    "Absence of proven track record in meeting sales or target goals; build this by taking on sales-oriented projects or roles in tech that involve client outreach, and develop interpersonal, negotiation, and presentation skills through training or networking events.",
    "Limited familiarity with financial regulations (e.g., CBK, AML/CFT, KYC); study these areas and seek exposure to compliance in fintech to meet the role's risk management requirements.",

  "summary_and_reasoning": "Your background as a full stack developer with strong technical skills in software engineering and AI fundamentals is impressive and positions you well for tech roles in fintech, where Umba operates as a digital bank leveraging machine learning. However, this Deposit Mobilization Relationship Officer role is heavily focused on sales, client relationship management, business development, and financial services experience—areas not reflected in your resume. With no relevant education, experience, or skills in banking, deposit growth, or compliance, the fit is very low at 5%. As a career coach, I recommend targeting tech positions within Umba or similar fintech firms (e.g., developer roles supporting digital products) to leverage your strengths. To pivot toward this type of role, start with finance certifications (like those from CFA or local banking institutes) and seek junior sales roles in microfinance to build the required 3+ years of experience."
